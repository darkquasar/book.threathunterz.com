# The Way of the Cyber Warrior

### Investigations into the transient fluctuations of reality in the cybersphere

A live book about Incident Response, Threat Hunting and Cyber Security Operations.

### <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Why? 

The idea for the book was born out of the necessity to organize my own knowledge and help disseminate practical approaches, concepts and techniques to the community.

### <i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> How?

This is a **live** book, which means it will be under continuous development until it reaches a critical mass of information that can be regarded as a "complete book". This approach is meant to allow me to share my knowledge as it evolves, instead of having to wait for 2 years until a "fully fledged" book is out. This method also allows for *content reformulation based on community feedback and contributions*.
