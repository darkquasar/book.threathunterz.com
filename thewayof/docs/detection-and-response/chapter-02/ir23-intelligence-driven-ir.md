## Intelligence-Driven Incident Response
Introduction. This can't be an extensive section but just an overview.

Maneuver warfare- This is a strategy used in the military that emphasizes disrupting the enemyâ€™s decision-making skills in order to defeat them. Maneuver warfare revolves around the ideas of surprise and deception. The concept of the OODA loop was derived from the strategy of maneuver warfare.

One of the main problems organizations face is to go from *identification and scoping* to *eradication* (pulling the plug). Thisis the wrong approach. You miss the opportunity to fully understand
**what** the attacker is doing, **where** it has been and **how** it
behaves in your network. Instead of "pulling the plug" we should aim to
perform **"Active Defense"** (full scale network/host monitoring,
canary, honeypots, data decoy, bit mangling, network segmentation)

There is a loop that helps define what a strategic approach might be. It
consists of a feedback between the
**identification/intelligence/scoping** and **containment/intelligence
development** phases.
