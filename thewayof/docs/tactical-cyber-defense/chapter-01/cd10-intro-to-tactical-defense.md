## Introduction


Tactical Cyber Defense is divided into four areas: 

- Detection & Response
	- Telemetry Collection, Alerting and Analytics (SIEM stuff, L1/L2 security analysts)
	- Threat Hunting
	- Incident Response (custodians of the CSIRP, advanced resources)
	- Threat Intelligence
- Security Engineering & Design
	- Vulnerability Management (scanning your systems with things like Tenable and managing patching of vulns)
	- Security Architecture (where you hire architects to ensure you deploy systems in a secure way and following standards)
	- Plaform Security (where your engineers sit, making sure the stack of security products in the company are well mainteined, incidents addressed and SLAs agreed with vendors)
	- Application Security
- Offensive Security & Active Defense
	- Penetration Testing & Red Teaming
	- Purple Teaming
	- Deceiving tactics, Honey Pot and Canary Token deployment
- Security Training & Awareness
	- End User education on secure practices
	- User onboarding & offboarding best practices
	- Phishing training
	- Industry relevant secure practices
